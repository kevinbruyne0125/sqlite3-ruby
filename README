= SQLite3/Ruby Interface

This module allows Ruby programs to interface with the SQLite3
database engine (http://www.sqlite.org).  You must have the
SQLite engine installed in order to build this module.

Note that this module is NOT compatible with SQLite 2.x.


== Compilation and Installation

Simply do the following, after installing SQLite3:

  ruby setup.rb config
  ruby setup.rb setup
  ruby setup.rb install

Alternatively, you can download and install the RubyGem package for
SQLite3/Ruby (you must have RubyGems and SQLite3 installed, first):

  gem install --remote sqlite3-ruby


== Usage

For help figuring out the SQLite3/Ruby interface, check out the
FAQ[http://sqlite-ruby.rubyforge.org/sqlite3/faq.html]. It includes examples of
usage. If you have any questions that you feel should be address in the
FAQ, please send them to jamis_buck@byu.edu.
